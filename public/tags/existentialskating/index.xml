      <description>To shred, or not to shred—that is the question: Whether &amp;rsquo;tis nobler in the mind to suffer The slams and bruises of outrageous fortune Or to take arms against a sea of troubles And by skating end them. To fall, to rest— No more—and by a rest to say we end The heartache, and the thousand natural shocks That skating is heir to. &amp;lsquo;Tis a consummation Devoutly to be wished. To fall, to rest— To rest—perchance to dream: ay, there&amp;rsquo;s the rub, For in that rest from skating what dreams may come When we have shuffled off this mortal coil, Must give us pause.</description>
