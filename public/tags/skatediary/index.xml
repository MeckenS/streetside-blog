      <description>What is it with that Mary girl? Dragging me to the skate park every day. As if I had a choice. What you don&amp;rsquo;t hear in those skate stories is that she leaves me behind if I don&amp;rsquo;t go to the park with her; it&amp;rsquo;s the only way I can keep skating! I&amp;rsquo;m thinking about joining Little Bo Peep&amp;rsquo;s crewâ€”sure, I might get lost, but anything is better than being stuck with Mary and those little wannabe skaters at the park (kickflip, kickflip).</description>
