      <description>What is it with that Mary girl? Dragging me to the skate park every day. As if I had a choice. What you don&amp;rsquo;t hear in those skate stories is that she leaves me behind if I don&amp;rsquo;t go to the park with her; it&amp;rsquo;s the only way I can keep skating! I&amp;rsquo;m thinking about joining Little Bo Peep&amp;rsquo;s crew—sure, I might get lost, but anything is better than being stuck with Mary and those little wannabe skaters at the park (kickflip, kickflip).</description>

      <title>To Shred</title>

      <description>To shred, or not to shred—that is the question: Whether &amp;rsquo;tis nobler in the mind to suffer The slams and bruises of outrageous fortune Or to take arms against a sea of troubles And by skating end them. To fall, to rest— No more—and by a rest to say we end The heartache, and the thousand natural shocks That skating is heir to. &amp;lsquo;Tis a consummation Devoutly to be wished. To fall, to rest— To rest—perchance to dream: ay, there&amp;rsquo;s the rub, For in that rest from skating what dreams may come When we have shuffled off this mortal coil, Must give us pause.</description>

      <description>Under what circumstances should we step off a path? When is it essential that we finish what we start? If I bought a skateboard that didn&amp;rsquo;t fit my style, no one would fault me for selling it. If I left a crew that disrespected me, no one would say that I had a commitment problem. But if I walk away from a seemingly promising skate route because my soul has other ideas, am I a flake?</description>
