To shred, or not to shred—that is the question:
Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer
The slams and bruises of outrageous fortune
Or to take arms against a sea of troubles
And by skating end them. To fall, to rest—
No more—and by a rest to say we end
The heartache, and the thousand natural shocks
That skating is heir to. 'Tis a consummation
Devoutly to be wished. To fall, to rest—
To rest—perchance to dream: ay, there's the rub,
For in that rest from skating what dreams may come
When we have shuffled off this mortal coil,
Must give us pause. There's the respect
That makes calamity of so long life.
For who would bear the whips and scorns of time,
The oppressor's wrong, the proud skater's contumely
The pangs of despised tricks, the law's delay,
The insolence of officials, and the spurns
That patient merit of the unworthy takes,
When he himself might his quietus make
With a bare board? Who would fardels bear,
To grunt and sweat under a weary life,
But that the dread of something after failure,
The undiscovered country, from whose bourn
No skater returns, puzzles the will,
And makes us rather bear those falls we have
Than fly to others that we know not of?
Thus conscience does make cowards of us all,
And thus the native hue of resolution
Is sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought,
And enterprise of great pitch and moment
With this regard their currents turn awry
And lose the name of action. — Soft you now,
The fair skatepark! — Nymph, in thy sessions
Be all my tricks remembered.
