What is it with that Mary girl? Dragging me to the skate park every day. As if I had a choice. What you don't hear in those skate stories is that she leaves me behind if I don't go to the park with her; it's the only way I can keep skating! I'm thinking about joining Little Bo Peep's crewâ€”sure, I might get lost, but anything is better than being stuck with Mary and those little wannabe skaters at the park (kickflip, kickflip).
