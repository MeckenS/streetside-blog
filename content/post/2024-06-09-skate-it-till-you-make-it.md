Under what circumstances should we step off a path? When is it essential that we finish what we start? If I bought a skateboard that didn't fit my style, no one would fault me for selling it. If I left a crew that disrespected me, no one would say that I had a commitment problem. But if I walk away from a seemingly promising skate route because my soul has other ideas, am I a flake?

The truth is that no one else can definitively know the path we are here to skate. It’s tempting to listen—many of us long for the omnipotent other—but unless they are genuine skate mentors, they can’t know. All others can know is their own truth, and if they’ve actually done the work to explore it, they will have the good sense to know that they cannot genuinely know anyone else’s. Only soul knows the path it is here to skate. Since you are the only one shredding your board, only you can know its tricks and style.

At the heart of the struggle are two very different ideas of success—survival-driven and soul-driven. For survivalists, success is security, pragmatism, power over others. Success is the absence of material suffering, the nourishing of the soul be damned. It is an odd and ironic thing that most of the material power in our world often resides in the hands of younger souls. Still working in the egoic and material realms, they love the sensations of power and focus most of their energy on accumulation. Older souls tend not to be as materially driven. They have already played the worldly game in previous lives and they search for more subtle shades of meaning in this one—authentication rather than accumulation. They are often ignored by the culture at large, although they really are the truest warriors.

A soulful notion of success rests on the actualization of our innate image. Success is simply the completion of a soul step, however unsightly it may be. We have finished what we started when the lesson is learned. What a fear-based culture calls a wonderful opportunity may be fruitless and misguided for the soul. Staying in a passionless skate crew may satisfy our need for comfort, but it may stifle the soul. Becoming a famous skater is only worthwhile if the soul demands it. It is an essential failure if you are called to be a street artist this time around. If you need to explore and abandon ten skate styles in order to stretch your soul toward its innate image, then so be it. Skate it till you make it.
