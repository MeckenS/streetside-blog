My name is Ethan Loney, this is just a little bit of history for me... 

Skateboarding isn't just a pastime for me; it's an obsession. The moment I step onto my board, the world fades away, replaced by the rhythm of wheels on pavement and the rush of adrenaline coursing through my veins. It's more than a sport—it's a passion that fuels every aspect of my being.

### my history

Skateboarding isn't just about the tricks—it's a lifestyle I live and breathe. From the moment I push off, representing my clothing brand, every kickflip and grind becomes an expression of my dedication. Riding the streets isn't just a thrill; it's a canvas where my brand and my passion intertwine, shaping both my style and my identity.
